Exercise
In order to prepare for your interview, we ask you to prepare an exercise that
will evaluate your skills in data analysis and reporting.

You have received herewith a dataset representing the results by commune
French vote on a fictitious referendum held in 2013.

We propose to answer the following question:
"What can you teach us about this data? "

For example, you can help you with additional public data:
- http://tiny.cc/a924gy
- http://tiny.cc/ia43gy
- http://tiny.cc/mc43gy

We invite you to work preferentially with Python or R.
During the interview, we will ask you to present your results and your approach
to get them (source code, tools used, etc.).

Remember to bring a computer! If you can not bring one, contact
us so that we can lend you one during the interview.

During the interview, you may be required to provide analysis
complementary in real time.
